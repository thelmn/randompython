"""
This is my first python project to help me learn the basics of python

It is an attempt at a matrix library.

Feature list:
-representation of 2d matrices
-insertion of elements at beginning or at any position
-internal Cursor class to take care of insertion point positioning. Could help in continuous iterative insertion
-addition and subtraction of matrices of same order
-multiplication of matrices and matrix with scalar
-division of matrix with scalar
-finding
    -cofactor matrix
    -adjoint
    -determinant
    -inverse
 of a matrix
 -fraction module to evaluate without decimals(to avoid problem with double precision floats in python)
"""

New modules:
    -primes
    -gcd
